# typeScript 

**TypeScript is a strongly typed, object-oriented, compiled programming language developed by Microsoft. It is a superset of JavaScript, meaning it extends JavaScript by adding static types. TypeScript code is compiled into JavaScript so it can run in any JavaScript environment (browser, Node.js, etc.).**

## Advantages of TypeScript
